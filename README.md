# Computational Scoring and Experimental Evaluation of Enzymes Generated by Neural Networks



## Colab notebooks

| Notebook | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [ESM-MSA sampler](https://colab.research.google.com/github/seanrjohnson/protein_scoring/blob/main/colab_notebooks/ESM_MSA_sequence_generation.ipynb) | uses the ESM-MSA model (a transformer-based neural network trained on protein multiple sequence alignments) to generate new protein sequences by iteratively mutating sequences from an input alignment. |
| [Metrics](https://github.com/seanrjohnson/protein_scoring/blob/main/colab_notebooks/Protein_Metrics.ipynb) | Calculates various sequence- and structure-based quality scores for proteins, such as those produced by generative models. |
